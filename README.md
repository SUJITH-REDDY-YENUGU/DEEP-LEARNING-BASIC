# DEEP-LEARNING-BASIC
MY SMALL PROJECTS IN DEEP - LEARNING 


1) I tried building the vision transformer in medium level implementation using pytorch 
2) I tried building the image classification of animal data using pytorch but the results were not great
3) I build a model using transfer learning , i used mobile net v2 of size nearly 15MB which gave accuracy over the 95% .
4) The above model is now loaded in another file and there is proper interface of using gradio.
5) I used the kaggle small dataset for phone addiction classification.
6) I got the placement dataset but my model performed worse
